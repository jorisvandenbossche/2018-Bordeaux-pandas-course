# Why python?

---
class: center, middle

# Python is...

---

## …OPEN SOURCE

<br><br>

* No license costs!

---

## …READABLE

<br><br>

* It's easy to learn, easy to read and fast to develop
* Many scientists are not professional programmers

---

## …WIDESPREAD

<br><br>

* Python is one of the fastest growing languages for data science
* Large world-wide community ensures a large variety of **available tools** and **fast development**
* Used in **scientific** and non-scientific institutes <br> (Google, NASA, ESRI, VMM,...)
* Python is a standard in GIS, machine learning, ... <br> (commercial and non-commercial tools)
* **Multiplatform** (linux, windows,…)

## …WIDESPREAD

<br><br>

* Python is one of the fastest growing languages for data science
* Large world-wide community ensures a large variety of **available tools** and **fast development**
* Used in **scientific** and non-scientific institutes <br> (Google, NASA, ESRI, VMM,...)
* Python is a standard in GIS, machine learning, ... <br> (commercial and non-commercial tools)
* **Multiplatform** (linux, windows,…)

---

## …MULTI-FUNCTIONAL

<br><br>

* Python is used for many different problems, also beyond scientific computing (e.g. also for the web)
* Research and development: the python *scientific ecosystem*
* Great as ducttape/glue
* **Automation** of time-consuming returning tasks
* Easy to interface with other languages, in particular C and C++.  

---

## ... The Holy Grail ? No!

<br><br>
* Commercial packages give specific support  and more direct help-functions (cfr. MATLAB)
* Commercial packages can be more client-friendly
* For hard number-crunching, NOT the fastest solution
* R, Fortran, C++ etc are also ‘widespread’, so python is just a language amongst the others
* Risk of getting lost in the forest/flood of ‘useful packages’


---

# What is python?

<br><br>

* General purpose programming language
* Interpreted
* Dynamic typed
* Interactive usage
* Reference implemenation (CPython) largely written in C


???

- an *interpreted* (as opposed to *compiled*) language. Contrary to e.g.
  C or Fortran, one does not compile Python code before executing it. In
  addition, Python can be used **interactively**: many Python
  interpreters are available, from which commands and scripts can be
  executed.  
- a free software released under an **open-source** license: Python can
  be used and distributed free of charge, even for building commercial
  software.  
- **multi-platform**: Python is available for all major operating
  systems, Windows, Linux/Unix, MacOS X, most likely your mobile phone
  OS, etc.  
- a very readable language with clear non-verbose syntax  
- a language for which a large variety of high-quality packages are
  available for various applications, from web frameworks to scientific
  computing.  
- a language very easy to interface with other languages, in particular C
  and C++.  
- Some other features of the language are illustrated just below. For
  example, Python is an object-oriented language, with dynamic typing
  (the same variable can contain objects of different types during the
  course of a program).

# And many more tools

<br>

**Machine learning**: tensorflow, pytorch, keras, chainer, ...

**Performance**: Numba, Cython, Numexpr, C/Fortram wrappers, ...

**Visualisation**: Bokeh, Seaborn, Plotnine, Altair, Plotly, Mayavi, HoloViews, ...

**Data structures and parallel/distributed computation**: Xarray, Dask, Distributed, Cupy, ...

Specialized packages in many **scientific fields**: astronomy, natural language processing, image processing, geospatial, ...

**Packaging and distribution**: pip/wheels, conda, Anaconda, Canopy, ...

# Installing Python

---

# Installing Python
<br>
We **recommend Anaconda Distribution**, a Python distribution (= Python + most used packages) that targets (data) scientists: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

But alternatives: download from python.org/downloads/ and install packages with `pip`, other distributions such as Enthought Canopy, ..

The Anaconda Distribution comes with the **conda package manager**

---

# Conda
<br>
### Why using conda?

- Consistent package manager across Windows, Mac and Linux
- Many precompiled packages available
- Less problems with installation!

--

### Why different environments?

- Manage the dependencies of a specific project/paper/group/...
- You can install different version of Python and other packages alongside on your computer
- Easily share environments with other


---
## Small overview of conda commands

Creating a new environment:

```
conda create -n my_env python=3.5 pandas

# or from environment file
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activating an environment:

```
conda activate my_env
```

Install a new package:

```
conda install matplotlib     # if not working, try: pip install ...
```


List all installed packages: `conda list`

List all your environments: `conda info -e`

See the docs: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/index.html

---
class: center, middle

### Keep track of your python ecosystem <br>with an  `environment.yml`
<br><br>

```
conda env export > environment.yml
```

## Interactive Development Environment (IDE)
<br>
* [**Spyder**](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/) is shipped with Anaconda. The familiar environment for Matlab/Rstudio-users...
* [**PyCharm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Popular for web-development and Django applications, powerful when doing 'real' development (packages, libraries, software)
* [Eclipse + **pyDev plugin**](http://www.pydev.org/): If you like working in Eclipse, just add the python environment
* [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): new cool kid in town
* ...

## Jupyter Notebook

**Jupyter notebook** provides an **interactive** scripting environment that
interleaves text (markdown), code and output.<br>
Ideal for exploration, prototyping, tutorials, presentation and communication of results,
